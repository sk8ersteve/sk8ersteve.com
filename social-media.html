      We all know social media has some pretty severe issues. It's
      addictive and robs us of our attention and privacy. What's not often
      discussed is how we fix that. Here I would like to try to explain the
      root causes of these issues and how they can be addressed.
    </p>
    <h2>Money</h2>
    <p>
      All of the main-stream social media platforms today are created for the
      same end goal: profit. Profit leads companies to design there platforms,
      so that users will spend as much time on them as possible. This
      encourages content creators to make their content as attention
      grabbing as possible, which often does not correlate with the actual
      value associated with consuming the content. It would be nice to see
      a social media company that doesn't care to make ever growing profits
      but simply seeks to cover it's costs. Unfortunately, even if we take away
      the profit expectation, platforms still need money to operate and cover
      there costs, but eliminating the profit incentive might help reduce those
      costs. There are also ways that it could improve the usefulness of these
      platforms.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two major costs of operating a social media platform are labor and
      hardware. Hardware here includes servers as well as the infrastructure
      that gives us the internet. If we lived in a world where our resource
      abundance was actually used to provide people with free housing, food,
      and other necessities, that could help us on labor costs, but we don't
      yet, so we can think of something else. Eliminating the expectation for
      infinite growth might help because we can focus on building a platform to
      be sustainable, instead of trying to endlessly scale up and increase
      metrics that need to grow to increase profits.
    </p>
    <h3>Moderation</h3>
    <p>
      One of the biggest issues I have with social media is poor moderation.
      Not only is it costly for a company to hire workers to check for rule
      violations, but they also do a terrible job. The number of times
      I've reported an obvious bot account and had the request denied is
      ridiculous. I think this can be solved by developing a system which
      empowers users to democratically decide which accounts to ban from the
      platform. If this can be done in a way that accurately factors in the
      trustworthiness of different users in how they cast their votes, it
      could both save cost and greatly improve the experience of using the
      platform. It's also important to note that the infinite growth
      expectation encourages companies to ban spam accounts very
      conservatively because it boosts their user numbers. This perfectly
      exemplifies why society needs to get beyond this infinite growth
      expectation.
    </p>
    <h3>Unavoidable costs</h3>
    <p>
      We have been living in a tech bubble. Tech companies are currently valued
      far beyond their current profitability because investors have a high
      expectation of profit growth from these companies. These high valuations
      incentivize companies to hire far more engineers than they need in order
      to help them find ways to squeeze more and more profits every year.
      Changing the focus to sustainability would help but you would still need
      engineers to maintain the platform and add new features which would be
      valuable for users. If we can at least get one platform to a point where
      it is perfect as is, then that would greatly help but there will always
      be problems that arise. One could imaging leveraging open source but I
      would not advocate for that solution here since developers still need to
      get by. This would be feasible, however, if we did have basic necessities
      taken care of by society.
    </p>
    <p>
      Likewise, servers cost money to add and replace every year. Without the
      need for infinite growth, we do get to save some money, assuming our new
      focus successfully encourages creators to focus on quality over quantity.
      Still, hard drives fail, and unless we make content ephemeral, our
      total storage space will need to grow. Web 3.0 could be the solution to
      this but I skeptical. Everything involving blockchain or decentralization
      seems to involve some major sacrifice that we would not want to make, but
      I think it's worth looking into. Ephemerality is also not out of the
      question, especially if we can just pass the buck along to someone else
      like archive.org to archive everything for the future.
    </p>
    <h2>Getting the money</h2>
    <p>
      There seem to be just a few options for making this sustainable. I
      haven't discussed advertisements yet but I dont' want to rule them out.
      I'm heavily biased against ads but I expect the above modifications to
      lead to huge decreases in cost that would allow for less invasive and
      annoying advertising. My preference would be no ads and users just pay
      a very small fee to use the service. This could come in the form of a
      monthly/yearly subscription or microtransaction approach where users pay
      for platform currency that allows them to pay for exactly how much they
      use the platform. The latter is also very similar to how a blockchain
      approach solution would work but that's even more difficult to get users
      on board with. Of course, there's also the possibility for the government
      to subsidize these costs on the basis that this platform would be
      providing positive value to society. Unfortunately we are way too far
      from that possibility at least in the United States.
